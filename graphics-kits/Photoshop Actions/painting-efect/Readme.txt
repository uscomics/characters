Hi,

Thanks for purchasing the Painting Effect action.


This action has been tested and working on Photoshop (English version ONLY) CS3,CS4,CS5,CS6,CC+.

If you are not using the English version of Photoshop, you can always change it to English
and then back again to your native language using this method below.


__________________________________________________________________________________________


Please check: 

1. Your photo is in RGB color mode

2. Your photo is in 8bit color mode

3. You are running the English version of Photoshop.

4. If you are experiencing errors, try resetting your Photoshop preferences. To do this,
hold down Alt, Ctrl, and Shift keys (Mac: Command, Option, Shift) while starting up Photoshop. 
A dialog box will appear asking if you wish to delete the preferences/settings file.  

5. Avoid using small resolution images. For the best results, use Photos between 
1500px - 3500px high/wide.

HOW TO INSTALL THE ACTION

will now appear to the right hand side.

HOW TO USE THE ACTION
------------------------------------------------------

1. Open a photo to work with

2. Leave the photo layer locked and set as the 'Background'. To set your photo
as the Background, select your photo layer and go to the menu 'Layer' --> 'New'
--> 'Layer from Background..'. Please also refer to the video tutorial if you need
more help here.

3. Create a new layer above the background layer called 'brush'. MUST be all lowercase.

4. With your 'brush' layer selected, fill in your subject with a color.

5. Now choose a direction and click play on the action!

Again please watch the above video tutorial for a demonstration of these
steps. I also cover some important customisation techniques that you will 
want to use.
