how to apply action:

-To open these action presets in Photoshop, simply double click on the .atn file.

-To have these presets loaded in your Photoshop actions panel by default, find the folder 

entitled "actions" within your Photoshop folders, and drag and drop the .atn file in it.

-To use these actions, open up the Photoshop action menu (window-> actions) and with a photo opened 

and selected in the layers panel, select an action and click the play triangle!


100% its good working............Keep in mind that Pictures are 

very delicate things. sometimes it may notcome out so well as on 

other photos, this is because of the difference in picture quality, 

lighting, tone and so on.……….
