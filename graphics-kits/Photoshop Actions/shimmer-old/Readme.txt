******IMPORTANT - PLEASE WATCH DEMONSTRATION VIDEO BELOW************

********************************************************************
__________________________________________________________________________________________

This action has been tested and working on Photoshop (English versions) CS3,CS4,CS5,CS6,CC.

If you are not using the English version of Photoshop, you can always change it to English
and then back again to your native language using this method below.

__________________________________________________________________________________________


Please check: 

1. Your photo is in RGB color mode

2. Your photo is in 8bit color mode

3. You are running the English version of Photoshop.

4. If you are experiencing errors, try resetting your Photoshop preferences. To do this,
hold down Alt, Ctrl, and Shift keys (Mac: Command, Option, Shift) while starting up Photoshop. 
A dialog box will appear asking if you wish to delete the preferences/settings file.  

5. Avoid using small resolution images. For the best results, use Photos between 
1500px - 3000px high/wide. Chances of the action running into errors will increase the
lower you go under 1000px high/wide.

TIPS
------------------------------------------------------

1. Play around with the 'Background Tint' layer opacity. Especially
if you are using a photo that has a white background. This is a good one to experiment with
as soon as the action has finished. Dont forget you can also change the color of that tint!

2. The 'Background Parts' folders blend mode is set to Overlay - please experiment
by changing it to 'Lighten' or 'Screen' with your photo. If it is too bright, change it back
to Overlay.

3. Dont forget to hide layers that you dont want! If there is a sparkle that stands out
too much or doesnt look right, simply hide the layer. You can also use the 'Auto Select'
feature in Photoshop to quickly select a sparkle to identify what layer it is.

4. Try mixing the color options by turning multiple layers on and adjusting their layer
opacity.

5. Duplicate layers to build more sparkles.

HOW TO INSTALL THE ACTION

1. Inside Photoshop, go to the 'Window' menu and select 'Actions'. A window
will now appear to the right hand side.

2. Inside the Actions window, click on the top right hand corner icon to reveal
the drop down menu. From here select 'Load Actions...'. Select the action which
came with the download.

3. The action will now appear in the actions panel.

------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO USE THE ACTION
------------------------------------------------------

1. Open a photo to work with

2. Leave the photo layer locked and set as the 'Background'. To set your photo
as the Background, select your photo layer and go to the menu 'Layer' --> 'New'
--> 'Layer from Background..'. Please also refer to the video tutorial if you need
more help here.

3. Create a new layer above the background layer called 'brush'. MUST be all lowercase.

4. With the 'brush' layer selected, brush onto the areas of
your photo that you want to apply the effect to.

5. Now click play on the action!

Again please watch the above video tutorial for a demonstration of these
steps.
