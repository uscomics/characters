First, thank you for purchasing Sketchler Sketch Photoshop Action and supporting my work .

First before using this Action You must check few things:

1. You need to have English version of Photoshop

2. You need to have RGB Color checked ( Go to Image > Mode and Check RGB Color)

3. After, in that same panel check 8 Bits/Channel option

4. Go to Layers , Click on little icon in upper right corner and go to Layers Panel Options and check "Add "copy" to Copied Layers and Groups"


NOTE : After Action is completed you can close all folders by holding ALT and clicking on the main folder like "Adjustments" on litte arrow next to folder icon in layers panel




1. Go to the "Window" button in Menu and select "Actions"

2. In the Actions Panel go to the upper right corner and press that button and press "Load Actions"

3. Now go to the Sketchler Sketch Action folder and load "Sketchler Sketch.atn"

4. Sketchler Sketch Action in Actions panel will appear

5. Goto - Edit>Preset>preset Manager to load brushes and Patterns

6. Now Create new layer set the name "Brush" and brush your Image area you want

9. Now you can Run Color Dive Action


thats it
