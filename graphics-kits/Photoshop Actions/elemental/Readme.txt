Hi,

Thanks for purchasing the Elemental Photoshop action.

This action has been tested and working on Photoshop (English versions) CS3,CS4,CS5,CS6,CC,CC 2015.5+.

The action will only work on English versions of Photoshop.

It is highly recommended to work with photos over 1500px high/wide for the best results.

You must run the action in RGB color mode in Photoshop.


******IMPORTANT - PLEASE WATCH DEMONSTRATION VIDEO BELOW************

The video below will demonstrate how to use the action and how you can optimise the look
of your design after the action has finished.

HOW TO USE THE ACTION
------------------------------------------------------

1. Open a photo to work with

2. Leave the photo layer locked and set as the 'Background'. To set your photo
as the Background, select your photo layer and go to the menu 'Layer' --> 'New'
--> 'Layer from Background..'.

Also make sure your photo is in RGB color mode. To check this, go to the 'Image' menu, then
select 'Mode' and ensure 'RGB' is selected.

3. Create a new layer above the background layer called 'brush'

4. With the 'brush' layer selected, brush onto the areas of
your photo that you want to disperse. Use a hard brush and you can 
use any color.

5. Once you have brushed the areas you wish to disperse, go into the actions 
panel and choose which direction you want to disperse your photo. You can 
select UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT.

6. Now hit the play button found at the bottom of the action panel!

Again please watch the above video tutorial for a demonstration of these
steps.

If you would like to add some color grades to your design after the action has finished,
I highly recommend 'Photo Master'
