Hi,

Thanks for purchasing the Cell Shader Photoshop action.

This action has been tested and working on Photoshop (English versions) CS3,CS4,CS5,CS6,CC.

If you are using Photoshop CS3,CS4 - please use the action inside the "CS3,CS4" folder.
If you are using CS5 or above, please use the action inside the "CS5+ folder"

It is highly recommended to work with photos over 1200px high for the best results.

You must run the action in RGB color mode in Photoshop.

Please watch the below video tutorial on how to load the action and how to adjust
the look of your design after the action has stopped.
