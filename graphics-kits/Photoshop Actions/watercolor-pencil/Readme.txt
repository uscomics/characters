Hi,

Thanks for purchasing the Watercolor & Pencil Photoshop action.

This action is designed to work best with high resolution photos. Please avoid
using small photos under 1000px high. Ideally it is best to work with photos over
1500px high.

I have included an additional action file called 'Watercolor&Pencil_WithInstructions.atn. This
action will have pop-ups during the action to help guide you through to the finished result. If you
know how to use this action and don't require help messages, please just load the 
Watercolor&Pencil.atn file.

Please watch the below tutorial for a demonstration on how to use the action as 
well as important tips and tricks. You will get the best results experimenting
with the design after the action has finished.

Additional tips:

1: If you are using a dark image, please make it brighter before running the action. This will ensure
your photo subject is more defined after the action has stopped.

2: If your photo is very light, not much watercolor will come through on the photo. To address this, simply
darken your image before running the action.

3: Remember to go inside the folders 'Overlay Design 1' and 'Overlay Design 2' and select your watercolor 
layer, right click on it and select 'Replace Contents..' then select a new watercolor graphic to experiment with.
You can create many different results by replacing the textures after the action has finished.

4: Inside the 'Master Adjustments' folder, select the layer 'Edge Lightness (Change Opacity)' and try adding a 
Gaussian blur to it. Go to the menu 'Filter -->  Blur ---> Gaussian Blur'.
