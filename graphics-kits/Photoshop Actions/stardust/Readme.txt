This action has been tested and working on Photoshop (English versions) CS3,CS4,CS5,CS6,CC,CC2015.5,CC 2017+

If you are not using the English version of Photoshop, you can always change it to English
and then back again to your native language using this method below.

__________________________________________________________________________________________


Please check that:

1. Your photo is in RGB color mode

2. Your photo is in 8bit color mode

3. You are running the English version of Photoshop.

4. If you are experiencing errors, try resetting your Photoshop preferences. To do this,
hold down Alt, Ctrl, and Shift keys (Mac: Command, Option, Shift) while starting up Photoshop. 
A dialog box will appear asking if you wish to delete the preferences/settings file.  

5. Avoid using small resolution images. For the best results, use Photos between 
1500px - 3000px high/wide. Chances of the action running into errors will increase the
lower you go under 1000px high/wide. Photos with good color variation and contrast wil
work best.

HOW TO USE THE ACTION
------------------------------------------------------

1. Open a photo to work with

2. Leave the photo layer locked and set as the 'Background'. To set your photo
as the Background, select your photo layer and go to the menu 'Layer' --> 'New'
--> 'Layer from Background..'. Please also refer to the video tutorial if you need
more help here.

3. Create a new layer above the background layer called 'brush'. MUST be all lowercase.

4. With the 'brush' layer selected, brush onto the areas of
your photo that you want to apply the effect to.

5. Now choose a direction you want the effect to shoot off into and
hit the play button found at the bottom of the action panel.

Again please watch the above video tutorial for a demonstration of these
steps.

-------------------------------------------------------

Remember to experiment with all the different layers after the action has finished.
Duplicate, rotate, change blend mode etc. You can make incredible detailed designs
will only a few minutes of experimenting with the layers.
