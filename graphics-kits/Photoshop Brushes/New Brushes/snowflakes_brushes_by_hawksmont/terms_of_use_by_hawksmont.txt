Designing is nice and easy. I’d like you to feel this :) 
That’s why I’m sharing my workshop with you. 
I use those brushes in my designs and I don’t see the reason why you couldn’t use them in yours :D

1. Brushes created by hawksmont are free to use in non-commercial and commercial designs.
2. If you paid for those, you were cheated! Please note me about that fact at ir@hawksmont.com
3. You can give me a credit, but that’s not necessary :)
4. You can link me back when you use my brushes, but that’s not necessary too
5. I don’t approve violence, hate, racism and profanation, so MAY NOT use my brushes in those kind of stuff!
6. You may not claim these brushes to be your own.
7. If you have some problems with those brushes, please write me about that at ir@hawksmont.com
