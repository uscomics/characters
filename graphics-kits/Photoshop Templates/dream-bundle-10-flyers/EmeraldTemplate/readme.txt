Hi,

Thanks for purchasing the Emerald Flyer Template.

The PSD file is setup at 1275px x 1875px (4x6" with .25" bleeds) CMYK 300DPI

The PSD file is very well organised, with color coded groups and layers named appropriately.
The main folders that will require most customisation are highlighted in different colors.

I **HIGHLY** suggest to familiarise yourself with what folders do what, is to quickly go down the layer
list and turn off/on the visibility for the folders to see how that group affects the design.
This should increase your work flow knowing what each particluar folder does!!

Please experiment by turning folders off and layers because you can create several unique looks.

The free fonts used in the design are:

Compacta D : which can be downloaded here - http://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Uncategorized/44945/Compacta_D.aspx
Bebas Neue : which can be downloaded here - http://www.dafont.com/bebas-neue.font
HelbaInseratDB : which can be downloaded here - http://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Standard/13013/HelbaInseratDB.aspx

The images used in the preview on Graphic River can be fount at www.officialpsds.com
Contact me if you want me to link you to any of the preview images.

If you would like the alternate background look as seen in the preview image on Graphic River,
simply go inside the folder "BACKGROUND DESIGN" and check on the group "Optional Background". You
will need to change the text to white if you leave the bottom half black.

____IMPORTING YOUR IMAGE______________________________________________________________

Placing your image in the design is very simple.

1: Locate the folder called "YOUR IMAGE HERE***" (Highlighted in Purple)

3: Inside is a layer called "Right Click --> Replace Contents...", and you need to do just that!
Right click on the layer and select "Replace Contents.." A window will now open...

4: Select your photo and hit ok! Its that easy....

Note that you may need to scale your photo up or down depending on how big it is to
fit into the design nicely. Take the time to position it well and looking good. 

There are 4 other adjustment layers above the photo layers. Use these to tweak the look
of your image. If you decide to go for a blue color theme, then for the layer
"Color Tint Photo", you might want to use a blue filter to help match your image with
the overall design.

On the folder "YOUR IMAGE HERE***" is a layer mask (Black and white image). The white in 
the mask is the area that your image will be shown, the black areas hide the image.... you 
can simply brush more white or black into this mask. To hide the mask you can hold down
SHIFT and click on the mask and a red "X" will appear, or you can right click on the mask
and delete it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
____CHANGING THE TEXT___________________________________________________________

All of the text is located inside the folder "TEXT DETAILS HERE***" (Highlighted in Blue) 
and is layered in order of text on the top of the image down to the bottom.

The sticker text is outside of the main text folder and can be found in the "Sticker With Text"
folder.

___COLORS_________________________________________________________________________________

Here are a few ways to experient with the colors:

1: Inside the top folder "MASTER ADJUSTMENTS" are some layers that you can experiment with.
Simpy turn the eye on for the layers and drag the sliders around. You can also mix color
methods by using "COLOR METHOD 1" and turning on a layer inside the folder "Color Options",
you can create many different color variations this way.

2: Inside the folder "GLOW COLORS" is where you can change the color of the glows as well as
add more glow. Use the layer mask on the glow layers and brush (soft white brush) into it to
add more glow to the design. Brushing black will hide the glow.

3: There is a folder called "COLOR OPTIONS" that has as a few different color looks you can
experiment with. 

4: Some folders inside the the folder "BACKGROUND DESIGN" have layers setup called "Change Color".
This is just a quick way to re-color what is inside the folder.

5: The layers "Random Colors" and "Background Color Filter" are great ones to experiment with.
