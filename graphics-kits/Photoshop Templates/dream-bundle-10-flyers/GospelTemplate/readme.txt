Hi,

Thanks for purchasing the Gospel Flyer Template.

The PSD file is setup at 1275px x 1875px (4x6" with .25" bleeds) CMYK 300DPI

The PSD file is very well organised, with color coded groups and layers named appropriately.
The main folders that will require most customisation are highlighted in different colors.

I suggest to familiarise yourself with what folders do what, is to quickly go down the layer
list and turn off/on the visibility for the folders to see how that group affects the design.
This should increase your work flow knowing what each particluar folder does!! Inside the folder
"BACKGROUND DESIGN" are several subfolders named appropriately, though you may want to spend a minute
or two getting familiar with all of the design assets.

The fonts used in the design are "Edwardian Script" and "Times New Roman".

If you do not have "Edwardian Script" I suggest you try this very similar one:

Chopin Script : Which can be downloaded here :  http://www.dafont.com/chopin-script.font

____IMPORTING YOUR IMAGES______________________________________________________________

Placing your images in the design is very simple.

1: Locate the folder called "YOUR IMAGE HERES***" (Highlighted in Purple)

2: Inside are 3 more folders. The following techniques apply to all 3 folders.

3: Inside these folders are layers called "Right Click --> Replace Contents...", and you need to do just that!
Right click on the layer and select "Replace Contents.." A window will now open...

4: Select your photo and hit ok! Its that easy....

Note that you may need to scale your photo up or down depending on how big it is to
fit into the design nicely. Take the time to position it well and looking good. 

There are 4 other adjustment layers above the photo layers. Use these to tweak the look
of your image. If you decide to go for a blue color theme, then for the layer
"Color Tint Photo", you might want to use a blue filter to help match your image with
the overall design.

Below the photos are layers called "Image Area", this is the defined area for your photo,
so you can simply scale/rotate this layer if you like. You can also hide either of the image
folders if you only want 1 or 2 images.

The black bars that extend below the photobox's for text can be found inside the folder 
"BACKGROUND DESIGN" and in the folder "NAME BARS". These layers had to be placed here to
achieve certain light effects.

____CHANGING THE TEXT___________________________________________________________

All of the text is located inside the folder "TEXT DETAILS HERE***" (Highlighted in Blue) 
and is layered in order of text on the top of the image down to the bottom.

___COLORS_________________________________________________________________________________

Here are a few ways to experient with the colors:

1: Inside the top folder "MASTER ADJUSTMENTS" are some layers that you can experiment with.
Simpy turn the eye on for the layers and drag the sliders around. You can also mix color
methods by using "COLOR METHOD 1" and turning on a layer inside the folder "Color Options",
you can create many different color variations this way.

2: Inside the folder "GLOW COLORS" is where you can change the color of the glows as well as
add more glow. Use the layer mask on the glow layers and brush (soft white brush) into it to
add more glow to the design. Brushing black will hide the glow.

3: There is a folder called "COLOR OPTIONS" that has as a few different color looks you can
experiment with. 

4: I have setup 2 layers above the folder "BACKGROUND DESIGN" called "Background Color Tint"
and "Randomise Color". These are great ones to play with and mix, you can create lots of
color variations using.

5: The very bottom layer "Background Color" is also a great one to experiment with.
