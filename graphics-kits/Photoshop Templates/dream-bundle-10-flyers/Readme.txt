Hi,

Thank you for purchasing the Dream Flyer Bundle.

Inside each template folder is a readme file with instructions on how to edit
the template along with font links.

When you open up a template, you will need to turn the visibility on for
the 'DESIGN' folder. I had to switch this off to preserve file size on
the upload. So don't worry when you see nothing upon opening the templates.

I hope you enjoy using the files and have some great outcomes.

Please contact me if you need any further assistance with the templates.

Thanks for your support,
