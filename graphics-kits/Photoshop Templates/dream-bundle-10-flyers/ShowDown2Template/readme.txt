Hi,

Thanks for purchasing the Showdown2 Flyer Template.

The PSD file is setup at 1275px x 1875px (4x6" with .25" bleeds) CMYK 300DPI

The PSD file is very well organised, with color coded groups and layers named appropriately.
The main folders that will require most customisation are highlighted in different colors.

I suggest to familiarise yourself with what folders do what, is to quickly go down the layer
list and turn off/on the visibility for the folders to see how that group aff

Please experiment by turning folders off and layers because you can create several unique looks.

The free fonts used in the design are:

Big Noodle Titling: http://www.dafont.com/bignoodle-titling.font
Slant: which can be downloaded here - http://www.dafont.com/slant.font
Xtreme - http://www.dafont.com/xtreem.font

____IMPORTING YOUR IMAGE______________________________________________________________

Placing your image in the design is very simple.

1: Locate the folder called "YOUR PHOTO HERE***" (Highlighted in Purple)

2: Inside is a layer called "Right Click --> Replace Contents", and you need to do just that!
Right click on the layer and select "Replace Contents.." A window will now open...

4: Select your photo and hit ok. You photo will now be inside the design.

You may need to scale your photo up or down depending on how big it is to
fit into the design nicely. Take the time to position it well and looking good. 

I have setup a layer above the photo replacement layer called 'Enhance Contrast', use this
to adjust the look of your photo.

____CHANGING THE TEXT___________________________________________________________

All of the text is located inside the folder "TEXT HERE***".

The main title is located in the "Title" folder. Below are the steps to replace that text.

1: Double Click on the layer "REPLACE ME***" and you will notice that photoshop will open
up a new window with the text inside ready to replace.

2: So go ahead and change the font/text and then you MUST save the document... so save it
and close that window

3: Now the text will have updated in the main PSD file!

NOTE: You may need to scale your title up or down, so simply select the layer "REPLACE ME***"
and go to the menu Edit-->Transform-->Scale. Or, another way to do it is double click
on the "REPLACE ME***" layer and scale your text down from within the external document.

Dont forget you can use any font for the main title.

___COLORS_________________________________________________________________________________

Here are a few ways to experient with the colors:

1: Inside the top folder "MASTER ADJUSTMENTS" are some layers that you can experiment with.
Simpy turn the eye on for the layers and drag the sliders around. You can also mix color
methods by using "COLOR METHOD 1" and turning on a layer inside the folder "Color Options",
you can create many different color variations this way.

2: Inside the folder "GLOW COLORS" is where you can change the color of the glows as well as
add more glow. Use the layer mask on the glow layers and brush (soft white brush) into it to
add more glow to the design. Brushing black will hide the glow.
