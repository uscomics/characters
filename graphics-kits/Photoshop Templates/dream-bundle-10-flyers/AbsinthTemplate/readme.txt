Hi,

Thanks for purchasing the Absinth Flyer Template.

The PSD file is setup at 1275px x 1875px (4x6" with .25" bleeds) CMYK 300DPI

The PSD file is very well organised, with color coded groups and layers named appropriately.
The main folders that will require most customisation are highlighted in different colors.

I suggest to familiarise yourself with what folders do what, is to quickly go down the layer
list and turn off/on the visibility for the folders to see how that group affects the design.
This should increase your work flow knowing what each particluar folder does.

Please experiment by turning folders off and layers because you can create several unique looks.

The free fonts used in the design are:

Steelfish: http://www.dafont.com/steelfish.font
Great Vibes: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/great-vibes

____IMPORTING YOUR IMAGE______________________________________________________________

Placing your photo in the design is very simple.

1: Locate the folder called "YOUR PHOTO HERE***" (Highlighted in Purple)

3: Inside is a layer called "Right Click --> Replace Contents", and you need to do just that!
Right click on the layer and select "Replace Contents.." A window will now open...

4: Select your photo and hit ok! Its that easy.

Note that you may need to scale your photo up or down depending on how big it is to
fit into the design nicely. Take the time to position it well and looking good. 

I have setup a layer above the photo replacement layer called 'Toning (Change Opacity). Depending
on your photo, you can adjust this layers opacity to better match the design.

___COLORS_________________________________________________________________________________

Here are a few ways to experient with the colors:

1: I have setup a folder called 'MASTER ADJUSTMENTS'. All layers inside this folder will affect
the overall look of the design. You can experiment with layers here to adjust the look of the design.

2: Inside the DESIGN folder is another folder called 'COLOR VARIATIONS'. You can switch on the visibility
for these layers to experiment with different colors looks.
