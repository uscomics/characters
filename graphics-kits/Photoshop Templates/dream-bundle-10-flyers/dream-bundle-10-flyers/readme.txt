Hi,

Thanks for purchasing the Laurens Flyer Template.

The PSD file is setup at 1275px x 1875px (4x6" with .25" bleeds) CMYK 300DPI

The PSD file is very well organised, with color coded groups and layers named appropriately.
The main folders that will require most customisation are highlighted in different colors.

I suggest to familiarise yourself with what folders do what, is to quickly go down the layer
list and turn off/on the visibility for the folders to see how that group affects the design.
This should increase your work flow knowing what each particluar folder does.

Please experiment by turning folders off and layers because you can create several unique looks.

The free fonts used in the design are:

Franchise: http://www.dafont.com/franchise.font
Great Vibes: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/great-vibes
MVSans: http://www.fontsner.com/font/MVSans_Bold-17497.html

____IMPORTING YOUR PHOTO______________________________________________________________

Placing your photo in the design is very simple.

1: Locate the folder called "YOUR PHOTO HERE***" (Highlighted in Purple)

3: Inside is a layer called "Right Click --> Replace Contents", and you need to do just that!
Right click on the layer and select "Replace Contents.." A window will now open...

4: Select your photo and hit ok! Its that easy.

Note that you may need to scale your photo up or down depending on how big it is to
fit into the design nicely. Take the time to position it well and looking good. 

You can experiment with the layers above the photo replace layer i.e. 'Contrast', 'Add Color Tint',
'Toning (Change Opacity)' to adjust the look of your photo.

___COLORS_________________________________________________________________________________

I have included 3 PSD's in this file which you can reference from the preview image. There is
a black, blue and white version.

I have also setup a folder called 'Color Variations', you can use the layers in here to adjust
the color of the overall design.
