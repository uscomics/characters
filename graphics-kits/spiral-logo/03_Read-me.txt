First of all, thank you for acquiring this Logotype. 

Inside this Folder, you can find the vector file (.AI and.EPS) and a folder with all the Symbol's color variation, ready to use!

We also added older versions, but use them only as a last resort, because gradients and text may suffer some changes, in order to be compatible with older versions.
